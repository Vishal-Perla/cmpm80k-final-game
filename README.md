# üéÆ Dream Blast

**Dream Blast** is a 2D puzzle-action game we built in **GDevelop** as the final project for CMPM 80K.  
It started as a simple prototype but quickly turned into a passion project where we went way beyond the basics ‚Äî writing over **1,000 lines of custom JavaScript** to push GDevelop past its limits.

## ‚ú® What Makes It Special
- Play as a superhero stuck in a nightmare, fighting enemies and solving puzzles to escape.  
- Use **clone powers** to distract monsters or stand on switches to unlock doors.  
- Continuous top-down movement with enemies that **chase, patrol, and attack**.  
- A unique **timeline mechanic** (fully coded in JS) that records and replays player actions ‚Äî not something GDevelop gives you out of the box.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
- **Engine:** GDevelop 5  
- **Code:** 1,000+ lines of custom **JavaScript** for mechanics like:
  - Timeline system (record/replay of moves + actions)

Dream Blast was built as a **class project**, but it turned into something bigger:  
a chance to learn how to hack around engine limits, collaborate as a team, and write a ton of real code to bring an idea to life.
